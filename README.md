# 🛺 INYA-AI: AI-Driven Dynamic Ride Optimization System

**Team Name:** INYA-AI  
**College:** Vidyavardhaka College of Engineering, Mysuru, Karnataka  
**Problem Statement:** Solving Peak-Hour Demand Imbalance and Reducing Ride Denials


## 🚀 Overview

Our AI-Driven Dynamic Ride Optimization System ensures seamless availability, fair pricing, and optimized routes. We integrate local drivers' insights—via voice messages, photos, and surveys—to enhance navigation and assist onboarding.

Key challenges addressed:
- Ride denials
- Surge pricing
- Emergency travel prioritization
- Route inefficiencies

Unlike traditional platforms, we incentivize drivers with:
- Cost reductions
- Priority access for emergencies
- Pre-booking for hospital visits, job interviews, and critical travel


## 💡 Key Features

- ✅ **Emergency Ride Priority & Safety** – Allocates rides for users in unsafe areas or critical situations  
- 🧭 **Smart Ride Matching & Route Optimization** – Matches passengers with nearby drivers using shortest-path algorithms  
- 🕒 **Pre-Booking Support** – Allows early booking for medical visits, interviews, and essential errands  
- 🎯 **Driver Rewards & Gamification** – Streak-based incentives to reduce ride denials  
- 🗺️ **Community Insights Integration** – Collects local driver feedback to improve real-time decisions
