            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Customer friendly app Namma Yatri is a mobility application built with a vision to effectively contribute to the Open Mobility initiative. The true strength of an open mobility initiative lies in a collective ecosystem of multiple mobility service providers to coexist on a common standard network. This allows for enhanced choice for customers to avail the benefits of a truly multi-modal offering. The application has been built on the Beckn Protocol, which is an open-source protocol.</p>
            <p>Namma Yatri App: Namma Yatri is an open network mobility application built with the idea to provide multi-modal service to the commuters without the involvement of any middlemen. This application is built on the common network standards defined by ONDC built on the Beckn protocol (open source). The common network standards allows for interoperability for any buyer app compliant with the network standards to offer rides.</p>

            <h2>Open Mobility</h2>
            <p>Open mobility as the name suggests is an open network where any mode of transport can contribute to provide services to commuters thereby removing the dependency on any third party organizations. The common network standards allows for interoperability for any buyer app compliant with the network standards to offer rides. The network allows for all forms of mobility operators ranging from auto rickshaws, taxis and public transport to coexist.</p>

            <h2>Our Vision</h2>
            <p>Since the Namma Yatri customer app will be offering multiple mobility services in a single app, We believe customers will prefer to use this for their daily commute needs. Cab and Auto Rickshaw drivers are the first contributors to this initiative. Any Cab and Auto Rickshaw driver can complete the KYC verification and start using Namma Yatri.</p>
